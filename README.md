# SpeedyPages

A blog template built with [**11ty**](https://www.11ty.dev/), optimized for blazing-fast performance. Includes [**AMP**](https://amp.dev/) configuration and responsive design. This template also includes [**DecapCMS**](https://decapcms.org/) ([formerly **NetlifyCMS**](https://www.netlify.com/blog/netlify-cms-to-become-decap-cms/)) for easy content management, allowing you to edit your blog posts and other content right from the web interface.

Additionally, this template features a custom image transformation system using [**sharp**](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/). With this system, any images uploaded through **DecapCMS** will automatically be transformed into **multiple sizes and formats** to optimize page load times and improve overall performance.

Overall, with **SpeedyPages** you'll have everything you need to create a custom blog that loads quickly, delivers an excellent user experience, and is easy to manage and maintain.
