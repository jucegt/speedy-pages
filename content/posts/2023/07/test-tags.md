  excerpt: The outline of this inner shore is most irregular, curving and bending
    in and out and back upon itself, making coves and points and creeks and
    channels, and often pushing out in flats with not water enough on them at
    low tide to wet your ankles.

# Example

This slopes gradually up for another third of the distance, to the foot of the sand hills, which seem tumbled into their places by some mighty power, sometimes three tiers of them deep, sometimes two, *and sometimes only one.* A third of the distance across the Beach, the meadow ends and sand begins.

The outline of this inner shore is most irregular, curving and bending in and out and back upon itself, making coves and points and creeks and channels, and often pushing out in flats with not water enough on them at low tide to wet your ankles.
